            <h2>About Me :D</h2> 
                <p>Hello friends/strangers!</p>
                <p>This is Xiong, and he is a first-year Ph.D. student in the Higher Education and Organizational Change Program at UCLA. His research interests are first-generation and/or low-income students' access to higher education, education policy, affirmative action and race-conscious admission, among others. His career goal is to become a tenure-track faculty either in the U.S. or somewhere in the world.</p>
                <p>Xiong is taking Asia AM 191A to learn more about GIS and how to become a critical digital map maker. His goal is to use GIS as an assest-base approach to represent social and political issues that communities of color are facing now and in the future.</p>
