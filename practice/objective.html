            <p>Our project highlights the experiences of graduate students within SEIS. We aim to elevate the ways in which our colleagues have found community, support, and practice self-care in their graduate school experiences. In other words, how do they cultivate a sense of belonging amongst the pressures that come with rigorous academic environments? This project both empowers students to reflect on their own experience of practicing self-care and affirms the necessity of maintaining balance throughout an oftentimes challenging experience.</p>
            
            <p>Specifically, we are interested in learning how SEIS graduate students navigate their experience at UCLA and in the greater Los Angeles area, with an emphasis on how they define community, support, and practice self care. Graduate students will have the chance to share their stories, elevating their experiences and identity outside of the research, teaching, and service. This will demonstrate how graduate students sustain themselves throughout the expectations of graduate school.</p>
