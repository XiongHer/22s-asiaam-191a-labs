                UCLA SEIS Community Experiences
                </h1>
        <h3>Project Background</h3>
        <p>Graduate students are an understudied and under-resourced population, yet are vital to the university community. At the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), there are 31,600 undergraduate students and 14,300 graduate and professional students. As of Fall 2021, there were 545 enrolled graduate students within Education graduate programs at UCLA.This project focuses on graduate students enrolled in the School of Education and Information Studies.

        </br></br>Anecdotally, as professionals who have worked directly with graduate equity, inclusion, and student success programming efforts, we can offer our own affirmation of how decentralized graduate students support services may be at a given university. Given the importance of a strong sense of belonging and graduate student well-being, this project aims to empower students to share how they define community, support, and self-care as they navigate the aforementioned tensions of graduate school.</p>

        <h3>About the Project</h3>
        <p>We aim to elevate the ways in which our colleagues have found community, support, and practice self-care in their graduate school experiences. This project both empowers students to reflect on their own experience of practicing self-care and affirms the necessity of maintaining balance throughout an oftentimes challenging experience.

        </br></br>Specifically, we are interested in learning how SEIS graduate students navigate their experience at UCLA and in the greater Los Angeles area, with an emphasis on how they define community, support, and practice self-care. Graduate students will have the chance to share their stories, elevating their experiences and identity outside of the research, teaching, and service.</p>
