            <h2>Ngoc</h2>
            <p>I am a first-year PhD student in the Higher Education & Organizational Change program at UCLA.My goal for 191A is to become autonomous and confident in my ability to be a critical digital map maker and responsible storyteller. More specifically, I'm interested in learning about community-based participatory research and strategies for combating drive-by scholarship as a researcher. I hope to gain the technical coding skills necessary to document and visualize the experiences of the individuals and communities at the center of my research.</p>
            <h2>Willa</h2>
            <p>Hi. I am a first-year PhD student in the Social Sciences and Comparative Education program at UCLA, with a concentration in race and ethnic studies. My research interests lie at the intersection of education and racial equity. As a critical digital map maker I hope to elevate and uplift voices that often go unheard. I am looking forward to gaining technical skills that will complement the strength of qualitative methodologies.</p>
