            <p>Graduate students are an understudied and under-resourced population, yet are vital to the university community. At the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), there are 31,600 undergraduate  students and 14,300 graduate and professional students. As of Fall 2021, there were 545 enrolled graduate students within Education graduate programs at UCLA. Yet compared to undergraduate students, there may be less efforts to support students outside of the individual relationships they have with their programs. This project focuses on graduate students enrolled in the School of Education and Information Studies.</p> 

            <p>Anecdotally, as professionals who have worked directly with graduate equity, inclusion, and student success programming efforts at the University of Washington and Stanford University, we can offer our own affirmation of how decentralized graduate students support services may be at a given university. Typically, students’ immediate networks are directly connected to their advising groups and/or lab groups. There can be power dynamics and a sense of competitiveness that exists within these environments that impact students’ sense of belonging and overall well-being. Research specifically emphasizes the role of community-oriented peer networks and access to information about resources are vital to promoting graduate students’ sense of belonging. Given the importance of a strong sense of belonging and graduate student well-being, this project aims to empower students to share how they define community, support, and self-care as they navigate the aforementioned tensions of graduate school.</p>
