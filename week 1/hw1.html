        <h2>About Me :D</h2>
            <p>Xiong is a first-year Ph.D. student at the Higher Education and Organizational Change Department at UCLA. His research interests are first-generation and/or low-income students' access to higher education, education policy, affirmative action and race-conscious admission, among others. His career goal is to become a tenure-track faculty at a R1 institution.</p>
            <p>Xiong is taking Asia AM 191A to learn more about GIS and how to become a critical digital map maker. With current technology, everyone has easy access to information online that it is hard to determine what is true/accurate versus "alternative facts". Thus, his goal is to use GIS as an assest-base approach to represent social and political issues that communities of color are currently facing now and in the future. He plans to use participatory action approach, working with local organizations and communities in the LA area to showcase their lives, cultures, foods, among other amazing stories that often hidden to the public.</p>
